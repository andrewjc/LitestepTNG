The following question concerns the implementation of single-input static hazard-free boolean functions in the context of \textbf{2}-input \textbf{2}-wide AND-OR-INVERT (AOI) gates. As you have probably deduced, AOI implementations can be derived by simply taking a product-of-sums expression and applying DeMorgan's theorem to it.

(Part A) You may have noticed that the function below fits very nicely within the AOI framework. Please map the function to an AOI implementation.
